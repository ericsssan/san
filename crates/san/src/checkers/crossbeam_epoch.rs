/// Detects unsafe operations in the `crossbeam-epoch` crate:
/// `Shared::deref`, `Shared::deref_mut`, `Shared::as_ref`, `Shared::into_owned`,
/// `Atomic::into_owned`, `Owned::into_shared`, `Owned::from_raw`,
/// `Guard::defer_unchecked`, `Guard::defer_destroy`, and `unprotected()`.
///
/// `crossbeam-epoch` implements epoch-based memory reclamation for lock-free
/// data structures. The central invariant is:
///   • Objects referenced by a `Shared<'g, T>` are guaranteed not to be
///     reclaimed ONLY for the duration of the epoch `'g` (the scope of the
///     `Guard` obtained by calling `epoch::pin()`)
///   • Once the guard is dropped, any `Shared` pointers derived from it may
///     point to freed memory — dereference is immediate UB
///
/// `Shared::deref(&self) -> &T` / `Shared::deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T`:
///   • The guard must still be active; the pointed-to object must not have been
///     reclaimed during this epoch
///   • For `deref_mut`: no other `Shared` or `Owned` reference to the same
///     object may be dereferenced concurrently — aliased `&mut T` is UB
///   • Null `Shared` pointers produce immediate UB (no null check performed)
///
/// `Shared::as_ref(&self) -> Option<&T>`:
///   • Returns `None` for null pointers (safer than `deref` for null handling)
///   • Still requires the guard to be active and the object to be live
///
/// `Atomic::into_owned(self) -> Owned<T>`:
///   • The `Atomic` must currently hold a valid, non-null owned pointer
///   • The caller takes exclusive ownership — the `Atomic` must not be
///     accessed by other threads concurrently, and must not be used for
///     further reads (they would be use-after-free or double-free)
///   • Null `Atomic` → calling `into_owned` is UB
///
/// `Owned::into_shared<'g>(self, _: &'g Guard) -> Shared<'g, T>`:
///   • Transfers ownership: the `Owned` is consumed; caller is now responsible
///     for ensuring the object is eventually reclaimed (via `defer_destroy`)
///   • The returned `Shared` must not outlive the guard's epoch
///
/// Common bugs in lock-free data structures:
///   • Dereferencing a `Shared` after the guard is dropped (use-after-free)
///   • Calling `into_owned` while another thread is still reading the pointer
///     (concurrent mutation of the reference count or the pointed-to data)
///   • Forgetting to call `defer_destroy` after `into_owned` (memory leak)
///   • Using `deref_mut` with aliased readers (concurrent readers via clone)
///
/// Real-world: RUSTSEC-2019-0009 (crossbeam-epoch 0.7) — a missing memory
/// barrier allowed Shared pointers to outlive their epoch protection.
