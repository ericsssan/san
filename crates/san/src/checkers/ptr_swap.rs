/// Detects calls to `ptr::swap`, `ptr::swap_nonoverlapping`, and `NonNull::swap`.
///
/// `ptr::swap(x, y)` performs a bitwise swap of the values at two raw pointers.
/// The caller must ensure:
///   • Both `x` and `y` are non-null, properly aligned for T, and valid for
///     reads and writes of size_of::<T>() bytes
///   • The pointed-to values are fully initialized (invalid bit patterns are UB)
///   • The two pointed-to regions may overlap (ptr::swap handles this) but both
///     regions must be within a single allocation (no cross-allocation swaps)
///
/// `ptr::swap_nonoverlapping(x, y, count)` swaps `count` elements:
///   • Same alignment and validity requirements as ptr::swap
///   • The regions `x..x+count*size_of::<T>()` and `y..y+count*size_of::<T>()`
///     must NOT overlap — passing overlapping regions is immediate UB
///   • Often misused with byte counts instead of element counts
///
/// Common bugs: passing raw pointer offsets from the same allocation that
/// happen to overlap, or confusing byte-count with element-count for the
/// `count` parameter of `swap_nonoverlapping`.
///
/// Stable since Rust 1.0 (`ptr::swap`) and 1.27 (`ptr::swap_nonoverlapping`).
